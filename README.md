# NFT Attributes DB :smile_cat::robot::car::art::black_square_button:

This project maintains a collection attributes for NFTs across the spectrum.

You might find this useful if you are collecting or making valuations for NFTs and want to compare lots of them.

Because there are millions of NFTs on the market now with heavy demand, this is one of the rare (only?) use cases of blockchain + machine learning which is useful today.

## How do I use it?

Right now, files are stored in the root directory as CSV files. You can open these directly with Microsoft Excel. Advanced use cases are also possible by opening with Python/Pandas and running a TensorFlow model to make valuations.

## Contributing

Each file in the root folder is just data. Consider this as the “distribution” for dear users who care nothing about how these files are made.

Then each file has a coresponding mini project folder that explains how to make and update that file.

I hope to add a workflow later for automatically running each project. But for now, the strongest emphasis will be on the immutable attributes of the NFTs. These are the attributes thaw will never change during the life of that NFT.

## Project scope

We are happy to accept new mini projects to support new kinds of NFTs. At this time, we are only accepting NFT tokens which are listed at https://github.com/MetaMask/contract-metadata.
